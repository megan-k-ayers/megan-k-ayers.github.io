I am a PhD Candidate in Statistics & Data Science at Yale University. My research focuses on recognizing and bridging gaps between theoretical causal inference methods and complex real-world settings where conventional assumptions fall short. In particular, my work is motivated by challenges related to environmental policy evaluation and textual data. 

I graduated from Lewis & Clark College with a B.A. in Mathematics and a B.A. in Physics in 2019, after which I worked as a data analyst at Cascade Data Labs in Portland, Oregon.
